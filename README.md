# AWS scripts
## Scripts for setting up EC2 servers.

Rename `defaults.properties.sample` to `defaults.properties`. This is where your config goes. (It should probably be renamed, also it would be nice to be able to pass these in as flags too)

Run with the deploy.sh script.
    
    bash deploy.sh
